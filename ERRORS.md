## Gradle smoke checks in restricted sandbox
**What didn't work:** Running Gradle with the default cache failed before project evaluation with `Failed to load native library 'libnative-platform.dylib' for Mac OS X aarch64`. Retrying with a fresh `GRADLE_USER_HOME` allowed `gradle --version`, but `gradle jar` still failed because Gradle's file-lock contention service tried to open a socket and the sandbox returned `java.net.SocketException: Operation not permitted`. Passing `-Dorg.gradle.cache.internal.locklistener=false` did not change that behavior.
**What worked:** No full Gradle compile worked in this sandbox. The useful partial workaround was `GRADLE_USER_HOME=/private/tmp/sfvoice-gradle-home gradle --version --no-daemon`, which confirmed the Gradle install itself can start with a fresh home.
**Note for next time:** Treat this as an environment blocker, not a JVM source compile error. Verify JVM examples outside the restricted socket sandbox or with a Gradle setup that does not need the lock listener.

## `mise run ci` in restricted socket/no-network sandbox
**What didn't work:** Plain `mise run ci` failed before project checks because Mix opens a local TCP lock/PubSub socket, ccache tried to write under `~/Library/Caches/ccache`, and uv tried to initialize/fetch from `~/.cache/uv`/PyPI. After those were redirected to writable temp/cache paths, Gradle still could not run Java or Kotlin tasks because it starts a daemon TCP server even with `--no-daemon`, and the sandbox returns `java.net.SocketException: Operation not permitted`.
**What worked:** Use `MIX_OS_CONCURRENCY_LOCK=0`, workspace-local `HEX_HOME`/`MIX_HOME`, the temporary Mix PubSub wrapper, `CCACHE_DIR=/private/tmp/sfvoice-ccache`, `UV_CACHE_DIR=/private/tmp/sfvoice-uv-cache`, and `UV_OFFLINE=1` with copied cached hatchling dependencies. That got Elixir, Rust, frontend, TypeScript SDK, Qi, Go, Python, Rust SDK, and C++ checks passing.
**Note for next time:** Do not chase Java/Kotlin source errors from this sandbox trace. The remaining blocker is Gradle's required sockets; run JVM Gradle checks outside the restricted socket sandbox.

## Python SDK unittest dependency checks in restricted sandbox
**What didn't work:** Running `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` with the system Python failed because `httpx` was not installed. Retrying with `UV_CACHE_DIR=/private/tmp/sfvoice-uv-cache UV_OFFLINE=1 uv run ...` failed because that temp cache did not contain `httpx`; retrying against the default uv cache failed because the sandbox could not open files under `~/.cache/uv`.
**What worked:** Run tests with system Python and a read-only `PYTHONPATH` composed from the unpacked uv archive cache entries for `httpx`, `httpcore`, `anyio`, `certifi`, `idna`, `sniffio`, and `h11`.
**Note for next time:** This verifies the SDK tests without network access or cache writes. Prefer a real editable install outside the restricted sandbox when possible.

## GitHub secret copy with local gh version
**What didn't work:** Running the secret-copy loop under zsh failed on bash-style indirect expansion (`${!name}`). Retrying under bash with `gh secret set --body-file -` failed because this installed `gh` does not support `--body-file`.
**What worked:** Run the loop under bash and pipe each value on stdin to `gh secret set NAME --repo OWNER/REPO` with no `--body` flag; this `gh` version reads the secret body from stdin.
**Note for next time:** Check `gh secret set --help` before choosing flags. Avoid `--body "$value"` because it puts secret values in the process command line.
